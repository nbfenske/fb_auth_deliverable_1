# fb_auth

An in-progress Flutter Android application which will allow university students to easily manage their classes
in a calendar application centered around college life. Special feature *will* include options to add external links like Zoom classes,
notifications for when a class or call is upcoming, and the ability to add office hours.

All of the code which we actually wrote for this project (i.e. not generated simply by creating a new flutter app) are contained inside
of the lib folder. If you are unfamiliar with the structure of Flutter applications, main.dart will be the file to go to if you want to
see the main screen/code for this application.
